"""Guards over the cctally npm + brew distribution surfaces.

Three related invariants protect the runtime-sibling loader pattern
(`bin/cctally` uses `Path(__file__).parent / "<name>.py"` to import
`_lib_*.py` and `_cctally_*.py` modules, so any install layout missing
those files crashes at import or first-use):

  1. Every PUBLIC `bin/_lib_*.py` / `bin/_cctally_*.py` runtime sibling
     must be listed in `package.json` `files[]` — otherwise `npm pack`
     excludes them and the late-loader in `bin/cctally` hits a missing
     path. v1.6.1 closed this leak for `_lib_share_templates.py`.
     Privacy is determined by `.mirror-allowlist`: a sibling that
     classifies `unmatched` (e.g. `_cctally_release.py` after the
     release-command-split privatization) is maintainer-only and never
     enters the npm tarball, so it MUST NOT appear in `files[]` either.

  2. Every path in `files[]` must classify as `public` against
     `.mirror-allowlist`. The npm-publish GHA workflow runs from the
     public clone, so anything filtered out by the mirror never reaches
     the tarball — regardless of `files[]`. `_lib_share_templates.py`
     was in `files[]` from v1.6.1 onward but classified as `unmatched`
     in the allowlist, so the v1.6.1 tarball still shipped without it.
     v1.6.2 closes the allowlist gap.

  3. `homebrew/cctally.rb.template` must install every PUBLIC runtime
     sibling into `libexec/bin` next to `bin/cctally`, or `_load_sibling`
     (which resolves `Path(__file__).parent / "<name>.py"`) hits
     `FileNotFoundError`. Once `_lib_semver` became an EAGER import at
     bin/cctally:213, that path fires during `cctally --help`. The
     formula uses a `Dir.glob("bin/_lib_*.py", "bin/_cctally_*.py")`
     pattern over the public-clone tree — so private siblings filtered
     out by the mirror naturally don't appear and don't need a reject
     filter in the formula.

The three checks are kept side-by-side so any future runtime sibling
addition trips every gate if any layer is misconfigured.
