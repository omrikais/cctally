"""Snapshot-rebuild cache infrastructure for the dashboard/TUI (#268).

Pure, unit-testable cache primitives for the per-tick `DataSnapshot`
rebuild. The dashboard's background sync thread rebuilds the whole
snapshot every `--sync-interval`; on a large instance a from-scratch
rebuild re-aggregates the entire history each tick and pegs a CPU core.
This module holds the cheap change-signals + immutable-aggregate caches
that let the rebuild recompute only the current/dirty slice and serve
immutable past periods from memory.

Design spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-04-dashboard-rebuild-perf-design.md

What lives here (M0):
- `SnapshotSignature` + `compute_signature` — a composite data-version
  signature over EVERY table the cached surfaces read (spec §3). Cheap
  `MAX(id)` b-tree descents + a `(count, max-rowid)` change-signal over
  the reset-event tables, plus a monotonic generation counter. When the
  signature is unchanged the rebuild can take the idle path.
- `new_min_timestamp` — the per-builder timestamp watermark (spec §3,
  Codex F1): the earliest EVENT time among genuinely-new rows, so a
  late/backfilled entry (new `id`, OLD `timestamp_utc`) forces recompute
  of the affected PAST bucket, not just the current one.
- `bump_generation` / `current_generation` — a monotonic counter bumped
  by any path that deletes/rewrites history in place (orphan prune,
  `cache-sync --rebuild`); part of the signature so a deletion that
  leaves `MAX(id)` unchanged still invalidates (spec §7, Codex F4).
- `BucketCache` — immutable per-past-bucket `BucketUsage` cache for the
  Group A calendar builders (daily / monthly / weekly), spec §5.1.
- `SessionCache` — immutable per-session aggregate cache over the FULL
  window for the Group B sessions builder, spec §5.2 / Codex F5.

Design invariants (spec §7):
- Every cached value is treated as IMMUTABLE — callers store finished
  aggregates and never mutate them in place (SSE client threads read the
  published snapshot concurrently).
- These functions take explicit `sqlite3.Connection` objects and plain
  values; no dashboard/TUI imports, no DB opening of their own.

`session_entries` / `codex_session_entries` live in `cache.db`;
`weekly_usage_snapshots` / `weekly_cost_snapshots` / `week_reset_events`
/ `weekly_credit_floors` live in `stats.db` (bin/_cctally_db.py,
bin/_cctally_core.py). `compute_signature` takes both conns for that
reason.
