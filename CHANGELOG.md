## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `bin/cctally-mirror-public --accept-skip-mismatch` flag — overrides
  the refuse gate when accumulated public-skip diffs significantly
  exceed the current publish commit's diff (long-skip-chain plus
  fix/chore-typed publish subject). Default behavior gains an
  `⚠ ACCUMULATED-DIFF MISMATCH` block surfacing warn-severity findings
  (max-ratio greater than 3× plus non-feat subject) and a hard refuse
  on the chain-greater-than-15 plus max-ratio-greater-than-5× case;
  the flag is the documented escape hatch for refuse situations the
  operator has reviewed and accepted.
- SQLite migration framework for `stats.db` and `cache.db` — per-DB
  registry populated via `@stats_migration` / `@cache_migration`
  decorators with contiguous `NNN_descriptive_name` ordering enforced
  at script load. Dispatcher handles fresh-install detection, bootstrap
  rename of pre-framework markers, per-migration `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`
  ownership, first-failure halts, and `PRAGMA user_version` fast-path.
- `cctally db status` — per-DB list of applied / pending / failed /
  skipped migrations with `--json` output. Glyphs: `✓` applied,
  `✗` failed, `·` pending, `~` skipped.
- `cctally db skip <name> [--reason …]` — manual escape for
  migrations that genuinely cannot succeed on a particular machine
  (e.g., poison pills). Skipped migrations are bypassed by the
  dispatcher; they do not run.
- `cctally db unskip <name>` — removes the skip mark and invalidates
  the `user_version` fast-path so the migration retries on next open.
- Uniform migration error sentinel: `migration-errors.log` shared by
  both DBs (cache.db entries prefixed `cache.db:<name>`); banner
  renders on the next interactive command and auto-clears when the
  same migration succeeds again.
- `bin/_sqlite-diff.py` — stdlib `sqldiff` fallback for goldens
  harnesses; includes `PRAGMA user_version` so framework correctness
  conditions surface in the diff.
- `bin/cctally-migrations-test` — 12 framework-mechanics scenarios
  spanning fresh install, partial-marker upgrade, failure → banner →
  clear cycle, downgrade detection, skip / unskip semantics, both-DB
  end-to-end, legacy-marker recognition by `db status`, post-backfill
  5h-dedup re-run, and skip-honored post-backfill semantics. Includes
  a lazy-adopted per-migration goldens loop under
  `tests/fixtures/migrations/per-migration/<NNN_name>/{pre,post}.sqlite`.
- `cctally setup` — one-command install: symlinks user-facing binaries into
  `~/.local/bin/` and adds additive hook entries (`PostToolBatch`, `Stop`,
  `SubagentStop`) to `~/.claude/settings.json`. Includes `--dry-run`,
  `--status`, `--uninstall`, `--uninstall --purge` modes.
- `cctally hook-tick` — internal per-fire runtime invoked by Claude Code
  hooks. Reads CC hook payload from stdin, runs `sync_cache`, conditionally
  refreshes OAuth usage (default 30s throttle).
- `~/.local/share/cctally/logs/hook-tick.log` — rotating per-fire log
  (1 MB cap, single-generation rotation).
- `~/.local/share/cctally/hook-tick.last-fetch` — OAuth throttle marker
  (sentinel file owned by hook-tick).
- Fixture harnesses: `bin/cctally-setup-test` (13 scenarios) and
  `bin/cctally-hook-tick-test` (7 scenarios), both wired into
  `bin/cctally-test-all`.
- Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-06-migration-framework-design.md`.
  Reference page: `docs/commands/db.md`.

### Changed
- The three pre-framework data-shape migrations
  (`001_five_hour_block_models_backfill_v1`,
  `002_five_hour_block_projects_backfill_v1`,
  `003_merge_5h_block_duplicates_v1`) are now framework-managed.
  Existing DBs auto-rename their legacy unprefixed marker rows on the
  next open via the dispatcher's bootstrap path; both `cctally db
  status` and `cctally db skip` recognize legacy names as applied
  even before the bootstrap has run.
- Column additions still go through the existing
  `add_column_if_missing(conn, table, column, decl)` idempotent
  guard — that sibling pattern is unchanged. The migration framework
  is for data-shape changes (backfill, dedup, rename, FK rewrite)
  only.
- Default integration is now hook-based. The legacy status-line snippet
  (`cctally record-usage` from `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh`) is no
  longer the recommended path but **remains fully supported** as an opt-in
  alternative documented in `docs/commands/record-usage.md`.
- `docs/installation.md` rewritten around `cctally setup`.
